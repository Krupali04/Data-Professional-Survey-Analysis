# Data Professional Survey Dashboard with Power BI

This project involves creating a dynamic dashboard in Power BI using data collected from a survey of data professionals. The dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query to ensure it was ready for analysis. After preparing the data, I built a structured data model by establishing relationships between tables and optimizing them for accurate calculations and visualizations.


To gain deeper insights, I created several custom measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), such as metrics for tool preferences, industry trends, and respondent demographics. The final dashboard includes interactive visualizations, allowing users to explore key findings like popular tools, career trends, and skill gaps.
